# Home-Clean PWA

A 100% offline-first, single-user Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps you track cleaning and maintenance tasks for items in your home. The interface is built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) using [HTM](https://github.com/developit/htm) for JSX-free templating and a small state manager powered by [preact signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/).

## Features

- **Area Types Management**: Create categories for different types of areas in your home (e.g., Room, Living, Dining, Balcony).
- **Areas Management**: Define specific areas in your home, each belonging to an area type (e.g., Kitchen of type Room).
- **Area Groups**: Create named sets of existing areas (e.g., Downstairs, Wet Areas) with many-to-many relationships.
- **Items Management**: Track unique physical objects located in specific areas (e.g., Fridge in Kitchen).
- **Item Parts Management**: Define sub-components of items that need maintenance (e.g., Fridge â†’ Door Seal).
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Each item part stores frequency (in days) and last maintenance date, with color-coded status indicators.
- **Simple Navigation**: Easy-to-use interface with hamburger menu navigation built with `preact-router`.
- **Offline Functionality**: Works 100% offline with all data stored locally on your device.

### Running Locally

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Start a local server:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8080
